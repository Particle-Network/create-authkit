# Create Authkit

Among all of the SDKs for Particle Auth, the Web SDK (@particle-network/authkit) is the most widely used and thus offers extensive support and flexibility in driving onboarding through social logins facilitating interaction with Particleâ€™s Wallet-as-a-Service.

The [Particle Authkit](https://developers.particle.network/api-reference/auth/desktop-sdks/web) SDK is the primary mechanism for configuring and using social logins. Whether youâ€™re starting from scratch or already have an onboarding or authentication flow set up within your application, the Particle Auth Web SDK is a simple yet powerful integration.
